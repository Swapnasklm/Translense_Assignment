Introduction
This project is a TypeScript-based React application that leverages Redux Toolkit for efficient state management and Bootstrap for a responsive user interface. It follows best practices for project organization, state management, and type safety.

Prerequisites
Make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your system to manage dependencies and run the application.

To verify, check for versions in your terminal. If needed, download the latest versions from the official Node.js website.

Project Setup
Create a Project Directory: Set up a new directory for your project files.
Initialize npm: Initialize a package configuration file to manage dependencies and scripts.
Installing Dependencies
A. Install React with TypeScript
Use a TypeScript-based template to set up a new React project. This creates a TypeScript configuration and sets up .ts and .tsx files.

B. Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux
Redux Toolkit provides a streamlined setup for Redux, while React-Redux connects React components to the Redux store.

C. Install Bootstrap for Styling
Bootstrap is added for responsive styling across components. Import the Bootstrap CSS file globally to apply styles throughout the app.

Setting Up Redux Toolkit and Store
Configure the Store: Organize the store setup in a store folder to separate concerns and enhance maintainability.
Create Redux Slices: Each feature-specific piece of state is represented as a slice in the features folder. Slices are self-contained, including actions and reducers.
Connect Components to Store: Wrap the main app component in a Redux Provider to allow components access to the store.
Adding Bootstrap for Styling
Bootstrap provides an extensive CSS framework for creating responsive and accessible designs. Once installed, import the CSS file in your main entry point to make the styles available globally.

Running the Application
Start the Development Server: Use the start command to launch the app on a local server.
Access the Application: Open the browser at the local development URL to view and test the app.
Optional Packages
React Icons: Provides a rich set of icons for UI enhancement.
Axios: Useful for handling HTTP requests, with a cleaner syntax and additional capabilities compared to native fetch.
Project Structure
The recommended folder structure organizes components, Redux slices, and types to keep the codebase modular and maintainable. Separate folders for components, Redux logic, and shared types enhance readability and organization.

TypeScript Tips
Type Inference: TypeScript can infer many types automatically, reducing boilerplate.
RootState and Dispatch Types: Use standardized types across the application for actions and selectors, improving code quality and type safety.
Prop and State Types: Clearly define types for component props and state, making components easier to understand and reuse.
Development Workflow
Component Development: Build modular components in the components folder.
Redux State Management: Use Redux slices in the features directory to manage state, actions, and reducers for each feature.
Connecting Components to Redux: Use actions and selectors in the components to interact with the store.
Command Summary
Initialize npm: Start a new package configuration.
Create React App with TypeScript: Set up the project with a TypeScript template.
Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux: Add packages for Redux state management.
Install Bootstrap: Include Bootstrap for styling.
Start Development Server: Run the application locally.
